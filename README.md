Read [this document](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/basics/structure.html) to understand the project
layout.

## Required Libraries
[Cinder](https://libcinder.org/) is the primary library used for the GUI and Audio.

Other dependencies are [CMake](https://cmake.org/) & [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), but both of those are also 
included within the current build.


There are no other external Libraries, for all the ones I used are now all built into Cinder. 
##Controls
To play the piano, you just type on your keyboard with the corresponding key. 

You can Also adjust the pitch and volume by using the small window and pressing one of the buttons. 

The Volume is on a Slider, and you just click and drag in order to change the volume, this is however quite glitchy, 
so I suggest try to not touch it. 

High pitch starts at C4.
Low pitch starts at C3
