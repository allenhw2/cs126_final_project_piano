# Wangy Beats

### What is this project?
The project I am proposing to make is a beat/music making application. It would allow the user to take pre made sound clips and add them to a a track. The user would also be able to use it as a soundboard that would just play the sounds upon clicking the icon. The application will hopefully allow for multiple layers of recordings so that it will allow for a fuller sound. The user will also be able to record their own sound effects to allow mixing in the the song. Overal the UI will be a squares, the squares repsent a place where you can put a beat down, and if you want more tracks for a single beat the number of rows increases. I do not think I can make it advance enough to make a complex song, but I think I can make it seem like beatboxing of sorts. 

### Why did I want to make this project?
I have always found beat makers and sound boards fun to mess around with. One of my favorite online simple beat makers is the incredibox web app (https://www.incredibox.com/) that allows people to make simple beat box tracks that sound good. I also want to just create something that someone can use to make actually make something, or just mess around with.

### What Do I need?
For external libraries I will be using a couple. The first of course is the already included Cinder audio plugin, although it does not count as a a external librabry. The second one I will be using is a plugin called Vamp , https://www.vamp-plugins.org/index.html. This plugin enables music analysis and beats per minute analysis. However it is not that good, because most of the plugins that are good of this type are expensive and cost money. For my third plugin I might use the Perry Cook Synthesis ToolKit, https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/stk/. This allows for easy syntehsis of music and sounds. Another option might be the audio libary Superpowered SDK , https://superpowered.com/.

### Timeline:
- Week One
  - create layout of the program itself and overall vision
  - Begin creating code in bits and pieces, first with the UI
  - Creating a working block based UI and test the Audio Libraries 
- Week Two
  - Create the code to allow the use to start making simple beat patterns
  - Source the files for the beats themselves and which should be included and which shouldn't 
  - Fix any problems with the UI
- Week Three
  - Create the multi track code option to allow for users to have mutiple sounds on the same beat
  - Fix The UI to be clean
  - Figure out how to export the song (maybe)
  
### Extra Goals
- Music Import and Music Export
- Sound manipulation
- Visualizer
